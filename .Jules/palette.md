## 2024-04-13 - Skip to Content Links

**Learning:** Skip-to-content links provide critical keyboard accessibility but were missing from the application's layout. Keyboard-only and screen reader users would have had to tab through the navigation menu on every single page load before reaching the main content.
**Action:** Adding a `<main id="main-content">` landmark wrapping the primary content and a visually-hidden (until focused) skip link at the very top of the `<body>` is a clean way to implement this pattern across all pages globally via the `BaseLayout`. Added global focus-visible indicators for better navigation visibility as well.
